Problem Statement : Find a feasible entry point into the market for a new EV startup.

Here the datasets contain information on number of EVs, charging stations, road tax, subsidies, fuel prices at state level.

Model 1 : A k-means clustering model is fitted into the combination of the datasets, and clusters are created which helped to disintegrate the market and effectively draw conclusions as to which states are more suitable for an entry point.

Model 2 : A linear regression model is fitted into the combination of datasets, and the feature coefficients are calculated, and based on top 3 features, the states are binned into categories to effectively address the problem.
